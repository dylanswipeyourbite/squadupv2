# SquadUp: The Home for the Obsessed

> *"Curing the loneliness of obsession"*

## The Problem We Solve

You wake up at 4:30 AM to run. Your coworkers think you're insane. Your family tolerates your race calendar obsession. You check weather apps like they're social media. You have opinions about gel flavors. 

**You're not crazy. You're just obsessed. And you're alone in that obsession.**

## The Solution

**SquadUp is a home for 5-8 obsessed endurance athletes** where your 4:30 AM alarm is normal, your weather checking is understood, and your gel debates matter deeply.

Not a social network. Not a tracking app. **A living, breathing squad that gets you.**

# How It Works

## 1. The Squad Experience

### Small by Design
- **5-8 people max** - Intimate enough to care, large enough to always have someone awake at 4:30 AM
- **Private squads only** - No public profiles, no discovery, no strangers
- **Multi-sport welcome** - Runners, cyclists, Hyrox athletes, triathletes - obsession unites us

### Natural Rhythms
Your squad develops its own patterns:
- **Dawn Patrol** check-ins at 5 AM
- **Suffer Score** ratings after runs
- **Sunday Planning** for the week ahead
- **Late Night Philosophy** - "Why do we do this?"

### The Chat That Gets It
Not WhatsApp with runners. A chat that understands:
- "Bonked at 20" means something
- "Track Tuesday ü§Æ" needs no explanation
- "Sub-3?" is a complete question
- "DN" at 10 PM means tomorrow will hurt

## 2. The Expert Team and Living Memory

### Silent, On‚ÄëDemand Experts (Modes)

SquadUp includes a team of named experts who only respond when explicitly invoked. No unsolicited AI messages.

- General Expert ‚ÄúSage‚Äù ‚Äî broad, grounded answers over squad data
- Coach ‚ÄúAlex‚Äù ‚Äî training plan interpretation and execution
- Data Analyst ‚ÄúNova‚Äù ‚Äî objective trends from Terra and chat logs
- Nutritionist ‚ÄúAria‚Äù ‚Äî fueling before/during/after from squad data/plans
- Race Strategist ‚ÄúPace‚Äù ‚Äî course/weather pacing, taper, logistics
- Recovery/PT ‚ÄúKoa‚Äù ‚Äî injury protocols, mobility, rest using prior threads

Multi‚Äësport by design: experts adapt per member and per question (e.g., running and Hyrox in the same squad). Captains cannot override sports; the squad‚Äôs reality drives context.

Invocation and UX:
- A floating action button in chat opens expert chips. Selecting an expert triggers a one‚Äëshot, mode‚Äëscoped response.
- Replies show the expert‚Äôs name/icon and read like normal chat messages.

Grounding and citations:
- Every answer must be grounded in squad data (chat, Terra activities, uploaded plans, vault artifacts). If there‚Äôs not enough evidence: ‚ÄúNot enough squad data to answer that.‚Äù
- Sources are referenced conversationally (inline/expandable), not as academic footnotes.

Tone:
- Match the squad‚Äôs vibe without copying errors. Be empathetic during setbacks; be concise/technical when asked.

Budget:
- Hard cap: ‚Ç¨1/month per squad across all experts. Degrade (shorter/context‚Äëlimited) ‚Üí refuse when exceeded.

Privacy:
- Within a squad, all members‚Äô data are accessible to experts by default. Items explicitly marked private are respected and redacted.

Proactive behavior:
- Proactive callbacks are disabled for users. We may keep an internal feature flag for experiments, off by default.

### Living Memory (Passive)

The Knowledge Vault passively accumulates your squad‚Äôs artifacts and history. It never speaks on its own. Experts use it as evidence when answering mode‚Äëscoped questions.
